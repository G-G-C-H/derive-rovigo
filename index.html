<!-- What is a derive -->
<div class="my-fun-class">
    <p>The dérive (French: [de.ʁiv], "drift") is a revolutionary strategy originally
      put forward in the "Theory of the Dérive" (1956) by Guy Debord, a member
      at the time of the Letterist International. Debord defines the dérive
      as "a mode of experimental behavior linked to the conditions of urban society:
      a technique of rapid passage through varied ambiances." It is an unplanned
      journey through a landscape, usually urban, in which participants drop their
      everyday relations and "let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the
      terrain and the encounters they find there". The dérive's goals include
      studying the terrain of the city (psychogeography) and emotional disorientation,
      both of which lead to the potential creation of Situations.</p>

            "The other day a friend and I took a Street View city break to Athens.
            Starting at the airport train station, we pretended to set our bags down in front
            of a Greek WHSmiths while we checked our guidebooks to plan a route into the city.
            Reenacting these intermediary moments, the ones that are slight and easily forgotten
            sometimes feel the most evocative." –From "Party in A Spreadsheet" by Marie Foulston
